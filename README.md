# House Price Prediction Project – Level 2 Task 1

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Data Analytics Internship (Oasis)** and focuses on **predicting house prices** using **Linear Regression**.  
The main goal is to build a **machine learning model** that can estimate house prices based on various features.

## Objective
- Explore and understand the dataset  
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices  
- Evaluate the model's performance  

## Tools Used
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – for machine learning models  
- **Google Colab** – for running the project  

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is from kaggle 
- Contains features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc., and the target variable is the house price.  

## Steps Performed
1. **Importing libraries and dataset**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualizing relationships between features and price  
3. **Handling missing values and outliers**  
4. **Encoding categorical variables**  
5. **Splitting data into training and testing sets**  
6. **Building Linear Regression model**  
7. **Evaluating the model** – using metrics like R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
8. **Predicting house prices** – on new or test data  

## Output
- A trained **Linear Regression model** capable of predicting house prices  
- Visualizations showing relationships and predictions  
- Model performance metrics
